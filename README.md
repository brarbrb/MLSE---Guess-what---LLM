# 🎮 Guess What — MLSE Project

## Overview
**Guess What** is an interactive multiplayer guessing game built using a microservices architecture (Flask&Sqlite and AI model (we used ollama)).  
Players describe and guess target word while avoiding "forbidden" words generated by the AI.  
The system combines **Flask + SocketIO** for real-time communication, **SQLite** for persistence, and a **custom LLM core** for intelligent word handling.

## 🧩 System Architecture
The project is organized into three main parts:

| Service | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **web** | Flask backend serving APIs, SocketIO events, and frontend templates (HTML, JS, CSS). |
| **db** | SQLite database container for storing users, games, rounds, and chat messages. |
| **ai** | AI microservice (lm_core) responsible for generating target words, validating descriptions, and suggesting forbidden lists. |
